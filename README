plibv4/JulianDate

JulianDate uses Julian Days for date calculations instead of UNIX Epoch and is
well suited and geared towards pure date calculations, such as to iterate over
every day of a year, or getting the date of 36 months in the future.

Some may object that it is somewhat redundant in the light of PHPs own DateTime
class, but I wrote the first installment long before PHP's DateTime came into
life and I still find it to be quite useful when doing calculations for which
days as a resolution are sufficient.
